title: Cares
---

Thanks to [this song](https://youtu.be/Vc9pEb-Ej7U), Psalm 55:22 has been stuck in my head:

> Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.

This is a great verse because it tells me that God will never let "the righteous" be shaken. But wait, who is "the righteous"? This was written by King David, probably 3,000 years ago. Do I count as righteous?

Well, the answer is yes! 2 Corinthians 5:21 says:

> God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

I am righteous, because Jesus became sin for me when he died on the cross.

And so I can indeed cast my cares on the Lord. This includes even the small things, like having forgotten to do something around the house, or when I can't find my keys.

But I can also cast my biggest care on the Lord - the problem of my sin. The reason I can ultimately have peace is because Jesus has taken away my sin. One day I will have no cares at all because I'll be in God's presence and there will be nothing to worry about!

“My sin (oh the bliss of this glorious thought), my sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more: praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!”

Hallelujah and happy Easter!
