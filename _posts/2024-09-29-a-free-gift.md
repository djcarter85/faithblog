title: A free gift
---

This morning at church we looked at [Galatians chapter
2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians%202&version=NIVUK).
Verses 15 and 16 say:

> We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not
> justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too,
> have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ
> and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will
> be justified.

Paul is saying that justification (being made right with God) is by faith alone
(as opposed to based on the law - i.e. our good works).

This is a core belief of Christianity, and I am quick to affirm it in
conversation with others.

However, my assessment of my spiritual performance often betrays where my heart
really lies. If I have sinned in some way, I often feel like God could not
accept me; conversely, if I have done something good then I feel right with God.

This is a way of thinking that I need to challenge, because it denies the good
news of Christianity. God's acceptance of me is not on the basis of my obedience
to him, but rather on Jesus's.

Later on in church we celebrated communion, during which we sang "When I
Survey". The final verse says this:

> Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br/>
> that were an offering far too small.<br/>
> Love so amazing, so divine,<br/>
> demands my soul, my life, my all.

It is true to say that offering our lives to God is an appropriate response to
his free gift of righteousness. However, as I was singing those words this
morning something seemed a little off. Having thought about it over the course
of the day (it's currently 8.30pm), I have realised that if we're not careful,
we can resopi

- if we're not careful we can end up thinking that we _have_ to respond with our
  lives to be saved
- this is a denial of the gospel

i might say I believe in the free gift, but in my mind i think i often assume
that god will accept me based on how much of my life i give to god.
